To get Windows security event logs using Python, you can use the win32evtlog module in the pywin32 library. 
Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use this module to retrieve security event logs:
'''

import win32evtlog

# Set the log type to Security
log_type = 'Security'

# Open the event log
hand = win32evtlog.OpenEventLog(None, log_type)

# Set the starting and ending record numbers to retrieve all records
flags = win32evtlog.EVENTLOG_BACKWARDS_READ|win32evtlog.EVENTLOG_SEQUENTIAL_READ
start = win32evtlog.GetOldestEventLogRecord(hand)
end = 0

# Iterate over the event records
events = []
while True:
    # Read the next event record
    events_raw = win32evtlog.ReadEventLog(hand, flags, start)
    if events_raw:
        for event in events_raw:
            events.append(event)
            start = event.RecordNumber
    else:
        break

# Close the event log
win32evtlog.CloseEventLog(hand)

# Print the retrieved event records
for event in events:
    print(event.StringInserts)

'''
This code opens the Security event log, sets the starting and ending 
record numbers to retrieve all records, and iterates over the event 
records using the ReadEventLog function. It then prints out the StringInserts 
property of each event record, which contains additional information about the event.

Note that this code requires the pywin32 library to be installed. 
You can install it using pip:
'''
pip install pywin32

'''
Also, this code retrieves all security event logs, which may be a large number of records. 
It's recommended to filter the event logs by event ID or other criteria to retrieve only the relevant logs.
