The code you use to create an application in Windows will depend on the programming 
language and development environment you choose. Here are some examples of code snippets 
for creating a simple application in different programming languages.

These code snippets demonstrate how to create a simple graphical user interface 
(GUI) application with a button that displays a message when clicked. However, there 
are many different types of applications you can create in Windows, and the code you write 
will depend on the specific functionality you want to implement.

    def __init__(self, master=None):
        super().__init__(master)
        self.pack()
        self.create_widgets()

    def create_widgets(self):
        self.button = tk.Button(self)
        self.button["text"] = "Click me!"
        self.button["command"] = self.button_click
        self.button.pack(side="top")

    def button_click(self):
        messagebox.showinfo("Message", "Hello, world!")
